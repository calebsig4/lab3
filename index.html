        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a 2nd year psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. My ideal job that I wish to achieve with my psychology degree is a high school guidance counselor, however this is not the only job I would be open to working. The main reason pushing me to become a guidance counselor is the wish to guide the younger generation through their troubles so I would be contenet in any ort of job doing something like that. I am hard-working, driven, and motivated hoping to find a workspace filled with others of the same character traits. I have spent my higher education career studying the brain both at the biological and cognitive level so I am prepared for any job that requires an education of the mind.   <br><br>

        I am from East Los Angeles coming from an immigrant hispanic family. I have worked since I was legally allowed at the age of 16, working both summer jobs and as a student. Ive also involved myself with organizations and club both throughout high school and college. I have constantly tried to get myself into jobs and organizations where I would work a lot with people, so I have developed people skills over the years. This is especially useful in the career field that I want to enter. I have also worked with and around kids in previous jobs so I know what it is like to work with children. I am a very hard and persistant worker constantly trying to get things done and make sure that the task at hand it is done to the best of my ability. I can work both with people or by myself, but I really do enjoy working with others. <br><br>

        Helping the youth is something that I am really passoinate about because when I was younger I really appriciated the people who would help me. This career choice was something that started off as me wanted to be a teacher, but I just did not feel like that was right for me. I eventually figured out that I wanted to kelp kids figure out their life problems instead of math problems. Weather it be intense personal situations or just help with college applications I want to help make the lives of kids easier and guide them through their situations. Today life as a kid can be so difficult for a number of different reasons so I just want to help make things easier for the younger generation. I hope that I can apply all the things I have learned both through my life experiences and my education to achieve my goal of helping kids make their way through life and achieve their own goals. Any job poisition where I can do that is one where I would be really happy.
